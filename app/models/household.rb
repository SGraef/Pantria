# A Household owns all food storage, grocery and price data. Homestead runs
# single-household-per-instance: one deployment serves exactly one household,
# resolved via {Household.current}. The schema still carries `household_id`
# everywhere (kept for non-destructive upgrades), but there is only ever one
# active household per install.
class Household < ApplicationRecord
  # The sole household this instance serves. Defined as the oldest household
  # (lowest id) so that databases upgraded from the old multi-household schema
  # deterministically pick one canonical household without touching the others'
  # rows. Computed fresh on every call (never memoize at class level) so the
  # first-run sign-up that creates the household, and tests that build one, see
  # it immediately. Returns nil on a brand-new, empty database.
  #
  # @return [Household, nil]
