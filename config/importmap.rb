# Browser barcode decoder used as a fallback when the native BarcodeDetector
# API is unavailable (Safari iOS, Firefox, …). Vendored under
# vendor/javascript/ so the PWA can serve it from the same origin --
# letting the service worker cache it for offline use and avoiding a
# cross-origin CDN hop on every cold load. Updating: re-fetch all three
# from jsdelivr and re-apply the import-path rewrites in vendor/javascript/.

# Leaflet map library for the garden map (lazy-imported by
# garden_map_controller only, so other pages never download it). Vendored
# same-origin like zxing above. Updating: re-fetch
# https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet@<version>/dist/leaflet-src.esm.js
# (dependency-free ESM, no import rewrites needed) plus dist/leaflet.css into
# app/assets/stylesheets/ -- and re-remove the url(images/...) rules there;
# we ship none of Leaflet's images.
